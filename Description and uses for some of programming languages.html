<th>Name</th>
<th>Description and uses</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Java</td>
<td>Java is object-oriented language. One of its main draws is that it’s very powerful and secure and so all of the banking application development happens in Java only. It’s perfect for someone looking to work in Android development, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, or game/desktop app development.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Javascript</td>
<td>JavaScript is used by Web developers and software engineers to manipulate page elements to make them more engaging. JavaScript enhances HTML, and it is embedded in most Internet browsers.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Python</td>
<td>Python is a high-level, object-oriented language and can be used for data mining and visualisation, machine learning, web applications, game development.Probably one of the easiest languages out there to start with for beginners because of how user-friendly its syntax is, how widely it’s used and what a big community it has around it. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C</td>
<td>It is a structure-oriented, middle-level programming language mostly used to develop low-level applications – meaning that it’s widely used for developing device drivers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ruby</td>
<td>Ruby is an object-oriented, high-level programming language. It’s also very beginner-friendly and you can start building things fairly quickly with the framework called Rails (this is where the expression Ruby on Rails comes from). It’s used for web app development, robotics, networking, system administration and security. It is great for simulations and is even used for those by NASA! Ruby is used for simulations, 3D modeling, and to manage and track information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C#</td>
<td>It is widely used for developing Windows desktop applications and games. It can be used for almost anything though, including gaming, web applications and is becoming increasingly popular for mobile development too.It is widely used in IT, Engineering, Design, Professional Services, Management and Quality Control.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PHP</td>
<td>PHP is a multi-paradigm programming language, designed for creating dynamic web pages that effectively work with databases. It is a general-purpose language and is widely used for Web Application Development, Server-Side Scripting, Command Line Scripting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Objective-C</td>
<td>Objective-C is an object-oriented language used by mobile developers and software engineers. Developers creating iOS and OS X utilities often use Objective-C.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C++</td>
<td>C++ is an object-oriented, middle-level programming language. It was created to be an extension of the C programming language that provides a higher-level of abstraction but is still powerful and efficient.It’s a general-purpose programming language that is used a lot to work with System/Application Software, Drivers, Client-Server Applications and Embedded Firmware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Go</td>
<td>Go is very new and hasn’t found its niche necessarily, but since it was designed to help solve “Google-sized” problems, it is great for complex problems. So if the idea of scaling software and systems excites you, it might be a great one to learn!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Swift</td>
<td>Swift is Apple’s general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language for iOS and OS X apps. It was created to preserve the main concepts of Objective-C (the other programming language you can use for iOS development), but to also catch bugs in a more eloquent way.</td>
